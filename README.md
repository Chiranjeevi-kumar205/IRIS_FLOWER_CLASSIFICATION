# IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION

Iris flower classification is a classic problem in machine learning and is often used as a beginner's example in the field. The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on certain features of their flowers. The three species are Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The dataset used for this classification task is called the Iris dataset, which was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of the three species, and there are four features measured for each sample:

Sepal Length: The length of the sepal (the green leaf-like structure that protects the flower bud).
Sepal Width: The width of the sepal.
Petal Length: The length of the petal (the colorful part of the flower).
Petal Width: The width of the petal.
we use algorithm knn to classify the model
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a simple algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
